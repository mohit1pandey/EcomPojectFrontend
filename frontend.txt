first we make the routing available
 npm i react-router-dom

->  now use this package and define some routes for diffrent pages and algo enclose the nav bar component
->  after defining the roots set the links for those routes


// for the sign up 
we first fetch the url running at backend then we performed a fetch requiest 
we also used the useNavigate hook to use navigate the user to / when he signs up (first time);

//store the users data into the local storage 

//creating private component to hide the component until the user is not signed up
make all components private and dont let them render till the user is not signed up


//*************************************//
login pages


/why we use useEffect/
we can access login/ signup even after we loged in or signed up bu 
127.0.0.1:5500/login
127.0.0.1:5500/signup

so every time the page re-renders we should check to the local storage.
